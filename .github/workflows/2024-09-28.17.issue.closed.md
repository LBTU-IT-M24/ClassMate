### Description

Since we are planning to add 7 components according to the project brief
and there is a chance of additional component appearance, we need a
solid base for components that would allow us to add drag-n-drop-able
components to a personal space board

### TODO

-   ☒ Create a base for component development

-   ☒ Add base component ability to save its settings (only opacity and
    background can be changed)

-   ☒ Add base component ability to save data if necessary (content of
    the component, like bookmarks or yt video url)

-   ☒ If component has no data, then settings modal will consist of
    plain settings view, but if data present, then show tabs (data,
    settings)
